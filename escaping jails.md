Escaping from Jails
--**rbash**--
Enum:
List the PATH content to see which commands are available. If ls is not available, you can echo * to “glob” the directory’s content:
```
echo $PATH
```
```
echo /usr/local/rbin/*
```

Vim/Vi:
```
:set shell=/bin/sh
```
```
:shell
```

Set environment variables to BASH
```
export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH
```
```
export SHELL=/bin/bash:$SHELL
```
